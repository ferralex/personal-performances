# Tracking my own performances
My working performance showed in data

I’ve always looked forward to feedback from my employees. Whether they are positive or negative, they are always helpful, they kind of show you if “the way” you are taking is the right one.

I decided to use Data Analysis to keep track of my current jobs’ performances and create an interactive dashboard showing them.
